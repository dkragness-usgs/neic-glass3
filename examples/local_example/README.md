# local_example

This directory contains an example of running glass-app for a single day using
a local pick set and configuration.

An example of the output for this configuration and input is included in the
output directory.

Note that travel time files will need to be copied from [the repository](https://github.com/usgs/neic-glass3/tree/master/glasscore/traveltime/tt-files)
into this directory before running the example.
