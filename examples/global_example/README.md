# global_example

This directory contains an example of running glass-app for a single day using
a global pick sent and configuration.

Note that travel time files will need to be copied from [the repository](https://github.com/usgs/neic-glass3/tree/master/glasscore/traveltime/tt-files)
into this directory before running the example.
