# ========================
# DK REVIEW 20180618
# This file should be separated out into two or more files, similar to what we do in Hydra
# Where project wide stuff should show up in one common file instead of having redundant
# copies, while sub-project stuff shows up in it's own file, pulling commone pieces as
# necessary.  The goal of course being not having redundant copies of the same "processing info",
# so that it doesn't have to be tracked/changed in multiple places.
# This file is already pretty short, but kinda seems like we should be able to get it down to 1 line.
