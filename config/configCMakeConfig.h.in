// DK REVIEW 20180618
// This file should be separated out into two or more files, similar to what we do in Hydra
// Where project wide stuff should show up in one common file instead of having redundant
// copies, while sub-project stuff shows up in it's own file, pulling commone pieces as
// necessary.  The goal of course being not having redundant copies of the same "processing info",
// so that it doesn't have to be tracked/changed in multiple places.
// ========================
// CMake configured options and settings
